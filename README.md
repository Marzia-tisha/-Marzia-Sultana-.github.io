# 👋 Hi, I'm [Marzia Sultana]

I’m a PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant in Anderson Lab, where I focus on the fabrication and characterization of ferroelectric materials and 2D films for next-generation RF communication systems. My work involves hands-on research in a cleanroom environment, where I’m actively learning and operating tools like lithography systems, spin coaters, SEM, AFM, and reflectometers to develop advanced nanoscale devices.

My academic background includes an M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Dhaka, with strong foundations in device physics, surface engineering, flexible electronics, and nanometrology. During my undergrad and master’s research, I worked on MOF-based water harvesting systems, sorption-enhanced PVT devices, and COMSOL-based pressure sensor simulations using 2D materials.

I'm passionate about bridging material science and electronics through innovative device engineering — whether it's developing new fabrication techniques or characterizing thin films at the nanoscale.
